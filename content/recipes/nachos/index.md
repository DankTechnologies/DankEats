### The Rest

* tortilla chips
* (optional) leftover meats, like [Chicken Carnitas](/recipes/chicken-carnitas/)
* (optional) sauce to drizzle, like [Orange Sauce](/recipes/orange-sauce/)

## Steps

1. Set oven to 375Â°F
2. Chop vegetables into bite-sized pieces.  Strain liquid from cut tomatoes, if using.  Rinse cut yellow or red onions, if using, to lower their intensity
3. Spread tortilla chips into single layer on parchment-lined sheet pan.  It's OK if the chips overlap.  If the chips have a curved side, face it up, so that the chip is a bowl instead of a table
4. Evenly layer half the cheese mix on the chips.  Add a layer of half the vegetable mix, except for cilantro which should be added after the bake.  Repeat with another cheese and vegetable layer
5. Bake for ~10 minutes. Cheese should be melted but not browned.  Cool for a couple minutes.
6. Finish with cilantro, sauce drizzle, and cotija, if you've got it.  Serve the sheet pan on a trivet
