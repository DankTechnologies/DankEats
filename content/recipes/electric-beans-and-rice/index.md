## Early Evening

Start around 75-90 minutes before you want to eat.  It's mostly hands-off.

### Beans

Dump soaked beans (with liquid) into Instant Pot, along with the onion, garlic, bay leaves, chicken bouillon powder, and chicken fat.  Add water to cover beans by ~2 inches.  Pressure cook for 8 minutes with natural release.  When pressure has dropped on Instant Pot, taste broth and add salt until it tastes good but not too salty.  Leave on warm

### Rice

Heat skillet on medium-high until it passes the water drop test{{< super-notes "1" >}}.  Add vegetable oil and tilt skillet to coat.  Add rice and mix with the oil.  Add salt and cumin.  Continue frying the rice until golden and lightly-toasted, stirring occassionally, about 5 minutes.  Add rice and broth to rice cooker, stir, and start.  When rice is done, wait 5 minutes before gently fluffing it

## Notes

1. **Water Drop Test** => AKA reaching the [Leidenfrost point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leidenfrost_effect).  In general, when searing or saut√©ing, add your meat or oil **after** the pan hits this point.  You'll have less issues with food sticking to the pan
