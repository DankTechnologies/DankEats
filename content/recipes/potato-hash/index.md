## Prep

**Tools** - cutting board, knife, peeler, small pot

1. Peel potatoes and dice into 1/2 inch pieces.  Put in pot, rinse with water, and repeat until water runs clear.
2. Remove pith from sweet peppers and cut into 1/2 inch pieces
3. Cut onion into 1/2 inch pieces as well
4. If not cooking right away, cover potatoes and leave soaking at room temp (few hours) or in fridge (1-2 days).  Cover sweet peppers and onion, move to fridge

## Make

**Tools** - sheet pan, 2 skillets (idealy one teflon + one not), strainer

1. Set oven to 500°F with rack in middle.  Add 3/4 cup **peanut oil** to sheet pan and tilt to get good coverage
2. Boil **potatoes**.  Add 1-2 tsp **kosher salt** and 1-2 tbsp **vinegar** to pot, stir, and set to boil.  When fork-tender, strain and leave in strainer until mostly done steaming (~5 min)
3. Move cooled potatoes to sheet pan and spread out. Sprinkle with kosher salt and move to oven.  Set timer for ~7 minutes, to check the potatoes and flip + rotate them around for an even bake.  Use timers to remind you to check the potatoes every few minutes.  When they are golden brown, move to a paper towel-lined plate-bowl, then remove paper towel
4. In parallel, cook the **sweet peppers** and **onions**.  Set not-teflon skillet over medium-high heat until water skitters across the pan{{< super-notes "3" >}}.  Add **olive oil**, followed by sweet peppers and onions.  Layer with kosher salt and pepper and cook for a couple minutes.  Add **chili powder** and **cayenne**, cook for a few minutes stirring occassionally. Lower heat to medium.  Cook until there's good color and some burnt edges.  If mix looks dry, add more oil. If potatoes are behind schedule, cut the heat
5. Add potatoes to hash.  Layer with kosher salt and pepper and cook over medium for a few minutes, then cut the heat or put on low when you're contented with it
6. Make anything you're topping or serving with.  Sunny side up eggs and buttery toast are the usual around here.  Avocados if you have them.  Sliced oranges in the winter

## Notes

1. **Use it up** => This is a versatile recipe, a very *what food is about to go bad* recipe
2. **Mini Sweet Peppers** =>  These small, sweet peppers are easy to find at grocery stores and taste great year-round.  Pricier than bell peppers, but those are usually terrible
3. **Water Drop Test** => AKA reaching the [Leidenfrost point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leidenfrost_effect).  In general, when searing or sautéing, add your meat or oil **after** the pan hits this point.  You'll have less issues with food sticking to the pan
