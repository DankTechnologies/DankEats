## Ingredients

* **1.5 - 2 lbs** chicken thighs
* **1/4 cup** mayo
* **1** lime
* **1 tsp** cumin
* **1 tsp** cinnamon-sugar mix{{< super-notes "1" >}}
* kosher salt
* flaky salt (optional)

## Marinade

1. Debone chicken thighs if needed, cut into bite-size pieces
2. In medium bowl, mix chicken with mayo{{< super-notes "2" >}} and 1 tsp kosher salt
3. Put in fridge uncovered for up to 12 hours

## Make

1. Take chicken out of fridge for at least 30 minutes, to take the chill off
2. Set skillet over high heat until water skitters across the pan{{< super-notes "3" >}}
3. Add **chicken** to skillet and spread out with spoon. Lower heat to medium-high and cook for a few minutes without stirring
4. Add 1 tsp **cumin** and a couple pinches of **kosher salt**.  Stir every couple minutes
5. Once the chicken is golden, add 1 tsp **cinnamon-sugar** mix and stir. Lower heat to medium and cook for a few minutes, stirring occassionally and gently{{< super-notes "4" >}}
6. Move chicken to serving plate, and finish with **fresh lime juice** and flaky salt (or kosher salt)
7. These are great in tacos, quesadillas, and hot hoagies.  You're gonna pick at the rest while you clean up

## Notes

1. **Cinnamon-Sugar** => You should keep this mix on hand, it's the best on buttered toast
2. **Mayo Marinade** => Yes, mayo.  Yes, this will look gross.  It sounds gross when you mix it too!
3. **Water Drop Test** => AKA reaching the [Leidenfrost point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leidenfrost_effect).  In general, when searing or sautÃ©ing, add your meat or oil **after** the pan hits this point.  You'll have less issues with food sticking to the pan
4. **Sticky Bits** => Don't scrape up the stuck-on, brown bits when stirring the chicken. After you're done and the skillet is cooled down, let the skillet soak with soapy dishwater for a while.  Lodge pan scrapers are the best tool for the job, for the rest
