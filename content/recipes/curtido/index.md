summary: this is my go-to cabbage slaw when I want something sweet and maybe spicy, but mostly vinegar-y, to balance out rich meat dishes, like [papas con chorizo](/recipes/papas-con-chorizo).  Traditionally, curtido is quick-pickled hours to days in advance, but I prefer this fresh version for its crunchy texture.  It comes together in 5 minutes

## Make

1. **Dressing** => add vinegar to microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 15 seconds or until warm.  This makes it easier to dissolve the sugar and salt.  Move to fridge to cool faster
2. **Produce** => use sharp knife and steady hand, or food processor, to finely shred cabbage and carrots.  [Julienne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julienning) jalapenos if using, and finely chop cilantro.  Combine in a large bowl
3. **Combine** => dump cooled dressing into bowl and use fingertips to break up Mexican oregano leaves and remove stems before adding.  Mix well and serve or move to fridge until ready
