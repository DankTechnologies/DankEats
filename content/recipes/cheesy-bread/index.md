summary: Most of my [hoagies](/recipes/soft-hoagie-rolls) end up as cheesy bread, which is the next bus stop after garlic bread.  Toaster ovens work great, and this comes together quick

## Ingredients

Scaled for 1 large hoagie roll (10"-12")

Precise measurements {{< stretch-text text="not recommended" >}}

* **4 tbsp** butter, room temp
* **2 tbsp** olive oil
* **1/4 cup** parmesan reggiano or pecorino romano, microplaned
* **1/2 tsp** garlic powder
* low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella, shredded
* dried oregano
* salt, to taste

## Make

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F
2. Slice hoagie in half lengthwise.  It takes some trial and error to get both pieces the same thickness
3. Put butter in small bowl/jar. Microwave for 10 seconds if hard.  Mix in olive oil, the microplaned hard cheese, and garlic powder to form a paste.  Taste for salt, add if needed
4. Spread evenly on the cut sides of the hoagie, going all the way to the edges.  Then top with even layer of mozzarella, so that there's no gaps but it's not piled too high either.  See the pictures below for the gist
5. Bake for 10-15 minutes until hoagie edges are golden brown and the cheese is taking on some color too.  Move to cooling rack and top with dried oregano
