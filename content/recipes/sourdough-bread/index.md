## Day 1 - Dough

1. Dissolve starter in water.  Add salt and flours, then mix by hand until combined.  Leave for 30 minutes
2. Do 3 or 4 rounds of stretch-and-folds, with 30 minute rest between rounds
3. Leave until at least doubled in size and jiggly when you shake the bowl{{< super-notes "2" >}}
4. Dump onto oiled counter and divide into 2
5. Gently pull sides to middle, flip over, and rotate to build some tension.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Leave for 20 minutes.
6. Flip over onto oiled counter, gently stretch into square.  Shape into b창tard
   1. Stretch and pull top to middle.  Gently press in seam
   2. Stretch and pull right to middle.  Gently press in seam
   3. Stretch and pull left to middle.  Gently press in seam
   4. Stretch and pull bottom to middle and roll forward, building some tension
7. Put into banneton upside down.  "Stitch" bottom to add some tension

## Day 2 - Bake

1. Preheat oven to 500째F with 2 dutch ovens for at least 45 minutes
2. Cut 2 parchment sheets that are slightly larger than bannetons
3. Cover bannetons with parchment sheet, flip upside down, and remove banneton
4. Score loaves from top to bottom at a near-flat angle, using the other hand to frame the knife and hold the loaves in place
5. Load parchment + loaves onto cookie sheet, upside down sheet pan, or pizza peel
6. Drop and center parchment + loaves in dutch ovens, optionally adding a couple ice cubes first
7. Bake covered for 20 minutes
8. Remove dutch ovens and transfer loaves to a sheet pan
9. Drop temperature to 450째F and bake for 15-20 more minutes
10. Move loaves to cooling rack and let cool for at least 4 hours before slicing

## Notes

1. **Hydration Level** => This is a 70% hydration dough, which is relatively low/dry.  This makes the dough easier to handle and build strength.  More water can be added, but try it this way first
2. **Longer Fermentations** => For more sour flavors, slow down the bulk ferment by moving to a cool spot, using less starter, or both.  Likewise, the cold ferment in the fridge can be extended by 12-24 hours
