## Notes

1. **Sourdough Starter** => It can be ripe or discard, doesn't matter
2. **Over-mixing** => No worries about over-mixing the batter; that's a [pancake](/recipes/overnight-sourdough-pancakes) thing
3. **Waffle Iron** => No need to grease the waffle iron.  If you don't have a flip waffle maker, get one!  My Presto one cost $40 in 2018 and is a beast
4. **Keeping Warm** => Waffles can be kept warm in 200Â°F oven, on oven/cooling racks and tented with foil
