Hi, I'm Dan K.  I sling software and pizzas.

This blog is a collection of family recipes that I've dialed in over the last {{< years-since 2010 >}}

There can be joy in practicing the same recipe over and over.  Each time is a chance to try something new, or try to fix the thing that went wrong last time, {{< stretch-text text="failing forward and leveling-up" >}} until... it's perfect.  You enter a zone where the success can be repeated, you know the ratios, the schedule and workflow is working for you, and {{< stretch-text text="people really like your food" >}}

So these are my big hitters, the ones people request and remember, that are on heavy rotation, on and on and on

Enjoy!
