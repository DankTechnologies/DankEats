## Night Before

1. In large bowl, mix ingredients in listed order.  Go easy when mixing the flour{{< super-notes "4">}}
2. Cover and move to fridge.  If you'll be up for a couple hours, move it to the fridge before you go to bed instead{{< super-notes "5">}}
3. If someone else gets up before you, leave them a note to take out the bowl when they wake up{{< super-notes "5">}}

## Morning Of

1. Heat griddle over high heat for 5 minutes or until smoking.  Then reduce to medium-low{{< super-notes "6">}}
2. If doing bacon, put strips on sheet pan and put in oven set to 375Â°F
3. In small bowl, mix milk with baking powder and baking soda
4. Pour milk mixture into batter and gently mix to combine{{< super-notes "4">}}
5. Let sit for a few minutes.  It should look light and puffy
6. You've got it from here.  Adjust the heat as you go, hot enough to get a good rise but cool enough to cook through.  My carbon steel griddle doesn't heat evenly, so I do two 1/2 cup pancakes over each burner

## Notes

1. **Sourdough Starter** => It can be ripe or discard, doesn't matter
2. **Baking Powder** => Too little or it's really old => flat pancakes.  Too much => metallic taste
3. **All-Purpose Flour** => You can sub in 10-30g of other flours to jazz it up.  30g rye flour, plus 1tsp almond extract instead of vanilla extract, is a nice twist
4. **Over-mixing** => Avoid, as it develops gluten which we don't want here. Use a rubber spatula and scrape the sides while gently moving wet to dry, until combined.  Think rock tumbler instead of circular motion
5. **Room Temps** => The room temp give the starter a chance to get going, resulting in lighter, airier pancakes.  The baking powder + baking soda activate better when the batter isn't straight from the fridge
6. **Griddle Prep** => I like to clean the griddle by spraying vegetable oil and quickly wiping it with a wadded-up paper towel
