## Notes

1. **Cinnamon-Sugar** => You should keep this mix on hand, it's the best on buttered toast
2. **Mayo Marinade** => Yes, mayo.  Yes, this will look gross.  It sounds gross when you mix it too!
3. **Water Drop Test** => AKA reaching the [Leidenfrost point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leidenfrost_effect).  In general, when searing or sautÃ©ing, add your meat or oil **after** the pan hits this point.  You'll have less issues with food sticking to the pan
4. **Sticky Bits** => Don't scrape up the stuck-on, brown bits when stirring the chicken. After you're done and the skillet is cooled down, let the skillet soak with soapy dishwater for a while.  Lodge pan scrapers are the best tool for the job, for the rest
