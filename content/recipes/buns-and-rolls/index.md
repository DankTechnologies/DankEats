## Ingredients

* **400 g** water
* **10 g** instant yeast{{< super-notes "1" >}}
* **15 g** salt
* **50 g** sugar
* **65 g** vegetable oil{{< super-notes "2" >}}
* **2** eggs
* **840 g** all-purpose flour

## Make Dough

1. In mixer bowl, combine ingredients in listed order, stirring after adding each
2. Run mixer for 10 minutes on low speed, then cover and let rest for 5 minutes.  Check for windowpane.  Repeat the _mix and rest_ cycle until dough passes the windowpane test
3. Remove dough and manipulate with your hands into a tight ball.  Put in greased bucket and cover.  Let rest until at least doubled

## Notes

1. **Yeast** => use half the amount in hot kitchens
2. **Fat** => if feeling fancy and using softened butter instead, add it last, with the mixer running, once the rest is coming together into a dry-looking dough.  Don't add it all at once
